Climate change intensifies heat waves and wildfire risks, with over 2,300 US deaths from heat in 2023 and widespread smoke from Canada affecting air quality.

3. Funding Uses:
Proposed federal funding would enhance community infrastructure with air filters and energy solutions to preemptively combat extreme weather effects.
