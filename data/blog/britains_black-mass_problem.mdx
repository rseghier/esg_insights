Revolutionizing #EVbattery #Recycling in #Britain
Key Takeaways:
- Recycling EV batteries can supply 43% of domestic mineral needs by 2040.
- The EU aims to reduce reliance on imported materials with recycling regulations.
- Technological and regulatory advancements are crucial for local recycling capabilities.

Further Insights
1. Recycling Challenges:
Extracting critical minerals from EV batteries involves crushing them into 'black mass' for processing, mainly in China.

2. Future Potential:
As the EV fleet ages, the demand for domestically recycled minerals will increase, supporting local industries and reducing dependency on imports.

3. Cost Barriers:
High costs and regulatory hurdles impede the establishment of local recycling facilities, making export the cheaper option.

Closing Thoughts:
As Britain contemplates its future in EV battery recycling, how will technological innovations and policy adjustments shape its self-sufficiency and environmental impact?
