3 Key Takeaways:

- Engage with suppliers to start decarbonization commitments immediately.
- Use science-based targets to guide and measure progress in supply chain emissions reduction.
- Transparency and consistent communication are crucial for cascading sustainability efforts through supply chains.

Further Insights:

- Introduction to Scope 3: Majority of a company‚Äôs emissions are often in its supply chain, underscoring the importance of tackling scope 3 emissions for holistic sustainability.

- Collaboration is Key: The value of cross-industry alliances and employing common sustainability frameworks signals to suppliers the importance of unified climate action.

- Real Examples Emerge: Companies like Philips and AstraZeneca illustrate the importance of engaging suppliers in sustainability goals, with Philips aiming for 50% of its suppliers to commit to science-based targets by 2025.

- Challenges of Data Collection: Accurating calculating scope 3 emissions is challenging but vital. Initiatives like CDP reporting and sector-specific intensity reduction methods support this.

- Advocating for Public Commitments: Public commitments to SBTi help create a culture of transparency and accountability, encouraging suppliers to follow suit.

- The Importance of Supplier Education: Practical steps to reduce emissions, like switching to renewable energy sources, are emphasized. Programs that educate suppliers on these measures are essential.
