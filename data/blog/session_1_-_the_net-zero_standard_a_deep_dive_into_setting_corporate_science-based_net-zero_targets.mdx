Unveiling the Corporate Path to #Net #Zero

3 Key Takeaways:
- Businesses must aim for 90% emissions reduction across all scopes by 2050 to meet #SBTI net zero criteria.
- Near-term targets should align with 1.5Â°C pathways, setting a robust foundation for net zero goals.
- Beyond value chain mitigation is crucial, focusing on emissions reduction and removal outside direct operations.

Further Insights:

- Introduction to SBTI
- The Science Based Targets initiative (SBTI) focuses on enabling corporations to set emissions reduction targets in line with climate science.
  
- Net Zero Standard Development
- SBTI's net zero standard was developed due to the rising adoption and scrutiny of net zero pledges. It aims to provide a robust benchmark for credible net zero targets.

- Key Elements of Net Zero Targets
- Companies should have near-term science-based targets (5-10 years), a long-term science-based target (by 2050), and strategies for neutralizing residual emissions.

- Beyond Value Chain Mitigation
- SBTI encourages companies to invest in mitigation efforts beyond their immediate value chains, including purchasing carbon credits and making direct investments in carbon removal technologies.

- Commitment and Validation
- Companies can commit to SBTI's net zero targets, undergoing a validation process to ensure their targets meet strict criteria.

- Communications Framework
- SBTI provides guidelines on how companies should communicate their net zero targets and achievements to avoid misleading claims.
