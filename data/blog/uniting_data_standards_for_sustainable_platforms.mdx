Unlocking #FHIR #openEHR for Future Health Data
Key Takeaways:
- Embrace open specifications like FHIR and openEHR for interoperability.
- Prioritize common data models to reduce errors and maintenance.
- Combine FHIR and openEHR to optimize data exchange and use.

Further Insights
1. Open Specifications:
Fast Health Care Interoperability Resources (FHIR) and openEHR offer frameworks for flexible, interoperable health data exchanges.

2. Data Challenges:
The diversity of data models leads to increased maintenance efforts and potential misinterpretation risks.

3. Data Model Standardization:
Adopting a universal data model approach can streamline data exchange and limit interpretive errors, saving costs.

4. Future State Platform:
A future state platform aims for an independent data layer, enabling application development and breaking data silos.

5. Technology and Treatment Evolution:
The rapid evolution of technology and treatments underscores the importance of adaptable and universally interoperable data models.

6. Synergistic Approach:
Integrating FHIR and openEHR leverages the strengths of both, facilitating efficient, meaningful health data exchanges.

Closing Thoughts:
As we stand at the cusp of a new era in health data management, how can organizations best prepare to meet the challenges and opportunities presented by openEHR and FHIR?
