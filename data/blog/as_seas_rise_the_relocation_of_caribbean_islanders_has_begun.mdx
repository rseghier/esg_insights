Further Insights
1. FORCED RELOCATION:
The Panamanian government began relocating 300 families from Gardi Sugdub island to mainland due to rising sea levels.

2. CLIMATE THREAT:
Islands at risk are less than one metre above sea level, with sea level rising 3.4mm yearly, exacerbated by heavier, more frequent storms.

3. RESEARCH INSIGHTS:
Steve Paton of the Smithsonian Tropical Research Institute predicts these islands will be uninhabitable by century's end.

Closing Thoughts:
This relocation story underscores a critical question: How can society better prepare and adapt to the inevitable impacts of climate change, especially for the most vulnerable communities?
