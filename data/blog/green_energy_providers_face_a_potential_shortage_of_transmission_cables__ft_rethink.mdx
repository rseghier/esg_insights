#GreenEnergy Evolution: #Xlinks and Global #Renewables
Key Takeaways:
- Long-distance green energy projects can be cost-effective.
- Demand for HVDC cables set to outstrip supply.
- Significant infrastructure and training investment required.

Further Insights
1. Capacity Growth:
Global renewable capacity projected to reach 7,300 GW by 2028, underlining a robust green energy evolution.

2. Xlinks Project:
The ambitious Xlinks project aims to transport green electricity from Morocco to Devon, UK, highlighting the potential of long-distance renewable energy transfer.

3. Cable Efficiency:
High Voltage Direct Current (HVDC) cables, crucial for long-distance energy transfer, lose approximately 3% energy per 1,000 km.

4. Market Dynamics:
The demand for HVDC cables for offshore wind projects and cross-border connections is growing, potentially leading to a shortage outside of China.

5. Supply Constraints:
With three companies dominating over 75% of the non-Chinese HVDC cable market, challenges in meeting the rising demand are significant.

6. Infrastructure Needs:
Building cable manufacturing facilities is expensive and complex, requiring high capital, specialist buildings, and access for cable laying ships.

Closing Thoughts:
As renewable energy capacity surges, the logistical and infrastructure challenges of connecting this power to the grid come into sharper focus. How might businesses and governments collaborate to overcome these impending bottlenecks?
