#EnergyTransition, #CapitalFlow, #GlobalSouth
Key Takeaways:
- Invest in all energy sources, focusing on reducing emissions.
- Urgent need for realistic, inclusive energy transition programs.
- Public-private partnerships crucial for unlocking capital in the Global South.

Further Insights
1. Capital Distribution:
Capital flow to renewables is concentrated in the Global North, leaving the Global South lacking essential investment.

2. Investment Challenges:
Despite the urgency of the energy transition, the cost and risk associated with deploying capital in emerging markets remain barriers.

3. Technological and Financial Support:
Technological advancements and financial mechanisms need to be tailored to support energy access and efficiency in the Global South.

4. Emission Reduction:
A shift towards renewable energy sources is crucial, but fossil fuels will continue to play a role in the global energy mix. Focus on emission reduction rather than completely moving away from fossil fuels is essential.

5. Infrastructure Development:
Developing countries need strong support in building infrastructure that can support the energy transition, including smart grid technology and efficient energy distribution systems.

Closing Thoughts:
Is there enough global collaboration and financial support to ensure the Global South can participate effectively in the energy transition, or will disparities widen? How can technology and capital be leveraged more efficiently to support the shift towards sustainability?
