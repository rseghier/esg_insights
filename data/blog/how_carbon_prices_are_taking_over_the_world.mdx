#CarbonPricing Expands Globally: Impact & Challenges
Key Takeaways:
- Global emissions under carbon pricing increased from 5% (2010) to 23% (2023).
- CBAM aims to prevent carbon leakage by taxing imports based on their carbon footprint.
- Challenges include low impact of some schemes and risk of greenwashing.

Further Insights
1. Global Shift:
Shift towards European model of carbon pricing, with mechanisms being adopted worldwide, even in historically high-pollution countries.

2. CBAM Introduction:
The EU's CBAM to levy carbon costs on imports by 2026, incentivizing global supply chains to adopt greener practices.

3. Emissions Trading Schemes:
Various countries ramping up efforts through national markets, emissions trading schemes, and linking dormant carbon-credit markets.

4. Flaws and Criticisms:
Critiques focus on insufficient price setting, potential for greenwashing, and lack of verifiable emission reductions.

5. Behavioral Change:
Despite limitations, carbon pricing encourages emissions monitoring and encourages gradual shifts towards greener practices.

Closing Thoughts:
With the expanding global footprint of carbon pricing, will we see a significant shift towards sustainability, or do the challenges present too great of hurdles? As business leaders, how can we navigate and contribute positively in this transforming landscape?
