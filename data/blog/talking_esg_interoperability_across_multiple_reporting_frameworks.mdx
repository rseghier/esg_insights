Navigating #ESG Reporting: #SEC, #CSRD & #California
Key Takeaways:
- Understanding interoperability is crucial for complying with multiple ESG frameworks.
- A data-first approach streamlines reporting across different standards.
- True reporting equivalence is rare, yet possible under specific conditions.

Further Insights
1. Interoperability:
Discusses the challenge of meeting multiple reporting requirements (SEC, CSRD, IFRS, TCFD, GHG) and the concept of interoperability vs. equivalence for efficient ESG reporting.

2. Data Strategy:
Emphasizes a data-first approach to identify commonalities in reporting requirements across frameworks, highlighting the importance of greenhouse gases data for streamlining processes.

3. Equivalence Challenges:
Explores the difficulties in achieving true equivalence between different reporting standards, including a rare example of full alignment under California's SB 261 for TCFD and ISSB compliance.

Closing Thoughts:
With the complexity of ESG reporting standards, how can companies leverage interoperability to enhance reporting efficiency and compliance? The journey towards streamlined ESG reporting begins with understanding the nuances of each requirement.
